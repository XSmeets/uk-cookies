The Republic’s ballooning budget surplus has further transformed public perceptions of what cross-Border co-operation might become. Yet the Shared Island Initiative is a unilateral exercise by the Irish Government, or more precisely by a part of Fianna Fáil. It reaches out to Stormont and the UK Government on an ad hoc basis and has no structured engagement with the NSMC. Where shared island projects cross paths with the cross-Border bodies, it is essentially by coincidence. Worse still for the NSMC, almost nobody seems to care.

The make-up look is equally minimalistic; if you’re striving for #sadegirl brilliance you’ll want to exude a naturally bronzed radiance and pair this with a dark red lip. Simple really.","type":"text"},{"_id":"XRYLWNAI4JD6PCOMVIP2AVA5YM","additional_properties":{"_id":"DWVGOZHXIRBO3K3RHSKWXQJOEA"},"content":"<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsaraouardi/video/7392540208954133793\" data-video-id=\"7392540208954133793\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@iamsaraouardi\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsaraouardi?refer=embed\">@iamsaraouardi</a> <a title=\"greenscreen\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreen?refer=embed\">#greenscreen</a> <a title=\"sade\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sade?refer=embed\">#sade</a> <a title=\"winterfashion\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/winterfashion?refer=embed\">#winterfashion</a> <a title=\"fashiontrends\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fashiontrends?refer=embed\">#fashiontrends</a> <a title=\"fashionprendi\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fashionprendi?refer=embed\">#fashionprendi</a><a title=\"contentsearchinsights\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/contentsearchinsights?refer=embed\">#contentsearchinsights</a> <a title=\"howtousecreatorseachinsghts\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/howtousecreatorseachinsghts?refer=embed\">#howtousecreatorseachinsghts</a> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Sara | Fashion Trends 2024\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7392540290223360800?refer=embed\">♬ original sound - Sara | Fashion Trends 2024</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"><\/script>","type":"raw_html"},{"_id":"ICB24LI3LFDHZAK3G4E5CW23J4","additional_properties":{"_id":1726061671963},"content":"Staying with autumnal vibes, Twilight and Twin Peaks coded aesthetics such as Pacific Northwest – or #PNW – are quickly gaining traction, with individual accounts dedicated to highlighting the mountainous pine-tree engulfed beauty of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/\" target=\"_blank\">US </a>states such as Oregon and Idaho.","type":"text"},{"_id":"LFLDSKFFXVBMVBDVMVVZRUQX6I","additional_properties":{"_id":1726061671964},"content":"Gaming trends have also taken a warm and wholesome turn, with #cozygaming and #cozydesksetup predicted to be big this season.

I think it highly unlikely that all the price increases we have endured as a nation,  as private consumers and small businesses, are down to true inflation. For example, our cafe got a complaint from a customer about the price we charge for our dairy-free milks. We charge 80c because of how much these milks cost us. A carton of Oatly from our supplier costs us €2.67, which means we don’t get it significantly cheaper than a consumer going into a supermarket. We get four to five cups per carton, about 60c each.  We lose money on this milk because by the time wages, electricity, rent, rates, VAT, etc are taken into account, the 80c is a loss-maker. We only make a profit from the shot of black coffee itself.","type":"text"},{"_id":"HVC7LRSAKFFS7EK4ZHLWC5FVUA","additional_properties":{"_id":1725453380868},"content":"Another example: it is possible to buy a basic block of Brie in Lidl for €1.50. To buy it from a food wholesaler (I’ve checked our suppliers) would cost well over €3.00 for a comparable block. No doubt, even at €1.50, Lidl are selling their Brie at a reasonable profit, and this shows the reality that large wholesalers have inflated their prices outrageously. As I see it, cafés and restaurants are getting the brunt of the “rip-off Ireland” conversation because they are the consumer-facing business at the end of a long supply chain. I would like to see large food wholesalers that dominate the market investigated to see if their price increases have matched inflation.  Investigations in the US showed that 50 per cent of inflation was simply corporations increasing profits.","type":"text"},{"_id":"QHX6DMAMGRENFMPNBALH2CBFO4","additional_properties":{"_id":"L2S47YOQEBCBBBAYTF6SZVYDGA"},"content":"Restaurant closures: ‘If it’s going to hit Dylan McGrath, it’s going to affect many businesses.

A carton of Oatly from our supplier costs us €2.67, which means we don’t get it significantly cheaper than a consumer going into a supermarket. We get four to five cups per carton, about 60c each.  We lose money on this milk because by the time wages, electricity, rent, rates, VAT, etc are taken into account, the 80c is a loss-maker. We only make a profit from the shot of black coffee itself.","type":"text"},{"_id":"HVC7LRSAKFFS7EK4ZHLWC5FVUA","additional_properties":{"_id":1725453380868},"content":"Another example: it is possible to buy a basic block of Brie in Lidl for €1.50. To buy it from a food wholesaler (I’ve checked our suppliers) would cost well over €3.00 for a comparable block. No doubt, even at €1.50, Lidl are selling their Brie at a reasonable profit, and this shows the reality that large wholesalers have inflated their prices outrageously. As I see it, cafés and restaurants are getting the brunt of the “rip-off Ireland” conversation because they are the consumer-facing business at the end of a long supply chain. I would like to see large food wholesalers that dominate the market investigated to see if their price increases have matched inflation.  Investigations in the US showed that 50 per cent of inflation was simply corporations increasing profits.","type":"text"},{"_id":"QHX6DMAMGRENFMPNBALH2CBFO4","additional_properties":{"_id":"L2S47YOQEBCBBBAYTF6SZVYDGA"},"content":"Restaurant closures: ‘If it’s going to hit Dylan McGrath, it’s going to affect many businesses.

That inevitably mixes with the dry waste, creating a bit of a damp dirt paste. So instead of easily emptying a little dust and dirt out of the tray, you are trying to shake wet waste out of it, and end up having to scoop it out instead.

After serving a short sentence he made it back to Berlin, just in time for a bonanza in the forgery business. After the anti-Semitic violence of Kristallnacht in November 1938, as the monstrosity of the Nazi regime became apparent, Jewish people were desperate to flee Germany and paid Salomon (Jewish himself) for fake passports and exit visas. As his opportunities for legitimate work dried up with every fresh anti-Semitic restriction, he honed his forgery craft. The forgeries had to be aesthetically perfect copies: forging documents, like printing money, is a game of cat and mouse between the legitimate printers and the enterprising counterfeiter. Official designers embedded security tricks within documents to protect against the fraudster.

He lived through the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic and was aware that money is a weapon like no other. He understood the phenomenal power of money: undermine money and you undermine the fabric of society. The plan for the Luftwaffe to drop millions of banknotes over Britain was top secret, only known by a few senior Nazis. While some honest subjects of the king might go to the authorities, Hitler worked on the basis that most British folk would stuff a few notes under the mattress. He would enlist the people Napoleon famously dismissed as a money-obsessed “nation of shopkeepers” against themselves. With this counterfeit money in circulation all over the country, inflation would rip through the system, particularly as so much of Britain’s economic resources were directed at the war effort. Hitler hoped that the previously quiet and obedient British would experience a fire-in-the-theatre moment.

Krueger, the Nazi, knew he needed Smolianof, the Jew. He found him languishing at Mauthausen and brought him to Sachsenhausen. Smolianof was to lead a motley crew of 142 Jewish specialists extracted from the concentration camps of the Third Reich. These men, who came from all over central Europe, had once been civilian printers, dyers, fine artists, engineers, engravers, metalworkers, mathematicians and photographers. The printworks in blocks 18 and 19 were shut off from the rest of the camp and no contact was allowed between the counterfeiters and the general camp population.
